# sql_to_csv_export_viceVersa_--API
An springboot API which will export the data from the SQL Database to a CSV formated file, and it will download that CSV file.

Again, !!

In another resource such 'export_from_csv' which will export all the new data from the csv file to sql database table. It'll not export the duplicate data during export. It'll only identify the uniqueness through the primary key mentioned in the table..
